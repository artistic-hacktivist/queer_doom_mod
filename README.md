# queer_doom_mod
Now you can rip and tear through doom1 and doom2 as a femboy! (mod currently in development)

WARNING
This mod is still early in development. The only textures that have been replaced are the arms, pistol, shotgun, and super shotgun. Also this has only been tested with gzdoom. There are graphical issues and bugs!!!

HOW TO ACCESS THE SOURCE FILES:
Simply open the wad with the editor of your choice. I recommend slade3 as it works well under linux. The reason the only thing in the repository is the wad is because slade does not let you unzip a wad and I am lazy.

HOW TO PLAY:
I'm assuming you have experience with doom modding. Simply load the mod with gzdoom as you would any other.
